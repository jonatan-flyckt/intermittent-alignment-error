# Intermittent Alignment Error

**Timing-aware metric for intermittent demand forecasting**

This repository contains the reference implementation of the *Intermittent Alignment Error* metric from the paper:

*Forecasting and evaluating intermittent demand with timing-aware global models and heterogeneous data*

The metric is designed to evaluate point forecasts for intermittent demand, taking both timing and magnitude into account.

A link to the paper will be added here upon publication.
